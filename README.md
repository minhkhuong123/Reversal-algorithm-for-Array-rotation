# Reversal-algorithm-for-Array-rotation
Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to rotate the array by d position to the left.  Examples:   Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, d = 2 Output: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2 Explanation: If the array is rotated by 1 position to the left,  it becomes {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1}. When it is rotated further by 1 position, it becomes: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2}  Input: arr[] = {1, 6, 7, 8}, d = 3 Output: 8, 1, 6, 7
